## 3. Multimodal AI: Is more always better?
J. Lipkova , UCI Health - University of California Irvine, Orange, United States of America

- Takeaways: Need to build multimodal datasets
- more not always better
- multimodal: no benefit for survival prediction in their work/use-case

## 4. Bringing clarity: Multimodal explainability for patients and doctors
V. Miskovic , Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy

- Quote: "All models are wrong, bu yours ara also useless" -> build useful models
- good overview of xAI -> see table in presentatoin
  - feature importance
  - saliency
  - attention
  - example based, counterfactual
- the most important critics:
  - overuse of post-hoc
	- lack of eval standards
	- instability variability
	- explanations do not make sense
	- lack domain specific context
	- risk of over-reliance
- run a trial data +/- AI to doctors:
		- use of xAI increases the probability of predicting the true DCR by 37%
- has build a nice gui and used LLM for explanation, explaining different prediction models used etc
