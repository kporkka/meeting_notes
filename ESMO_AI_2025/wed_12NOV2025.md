# Title: Multimodal AI for clinical decision support

## Multimodal AI assistants for molecular tumour boards
L. Verlingue , Centre Léon Bérard, Lyon, France

- BioMedParse radiology statements automatically to RECIST 1.1
- Clinical trial matching using local llm 
- Early discontinuation predictor 
- Simplification of MTB reports for patients using LLMs, see e-poster
- Working currently only with synthetic data as as the French legal framework for AI use not clear still! Lack of good synthetic datasets, opportunity for Synthia?
